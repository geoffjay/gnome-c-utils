Various utilities, useful when programming with GLib/GTK+, with the C language.

Some scripts are more general and can be useful for other tasks.

Installation
============

$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
[ Become root if necessary ]
$ make install


Tests/sample files
==================

There are sample files in the tests/ directory.


lineup-parameters
=================

Line up parameters of function declarations.

Example:

gboolean
frobnitz (Frobnitz *frobnitz,
          gint magic_number,
          GError **error)
{
  ...
}

Becomes:

gboolean
frobnitz (Frobnitz  *frobnitz,
          gint       magic_number,
          GError   **error)
{
  ...
}

Read the top of lineup-parameters.c for more details.


lineup-substitution
===================

Do a substitution and at the same time keep a good alignment of parameters on
the parenthesis.

Example:

function_call (param1,
               param2,
               param3);

Rename function_call to another_beautiful_name:

another_beautiful_name (param1,
                        param2,
                        param3);

lineup-substitution can be useful to rename a GObject class, or to change the
namespace of a group of GObjects, while still keeping a good
indentation/alignment of the code (in combination with lineup-parameters).

Read the top of lineup-substitution.c for more details.


multi-line-substitution
=======================

Does a multi-line substitution. Or, in other words, a multi-line search and
replace.

Read the top of multi-line-substitution.c for more details.


smart-c-comment-substitution
============================

Smart substitution (or, search and replace) in C comments. Can be useful to
change license headers. The script ignores spacing differences and ignores the
positions of newlines (where a sentence is split).

Read the top of smart-c-comment-substitution.c for more details.


check-chain-ups
===============

Basic check of GObject virtual function chain-ups.

Read the top of check-chain-ups.c for more details.
